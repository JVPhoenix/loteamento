# Loteamento R. Martins Website Infos

This is the website for one of my old presencial jobs in my born city (worked as Administrative Auxiliar).
They don't paid me for develop the website, i made it in my free times, just to increment my portfolio and bring a little comodities
in my day to day serving customers.

So, after approximately 2 years of presencial working, i moved from my born city to another city, mmaking it impossible to go to the company.
Then, i start to work remotely as a Frontend developar (and sometimes as a very beginner backend), since i was able to implement on the website, most of the company's systems.

Today, i still work for the company doing this two things:
1 → Frontend: Bringing new features, updates, fixing bugs and imrpooving UX/UI.
2 → Backend: Doing updates to the database, and developing integrations for the Frontend, to make available common users to do CRUD operations.

Sooo, thats all, thanks for reading.
