# React Website for Loteamento R. Martins

This is the website for my current half-period job (is my job in the day i'm writing this). They don't paid me for develop the website, i made it in my free times, just to increment my portfolio and bring a little comodities in in my day to day serving customers.

## Technologies used
Next, Typescript, and Tailwind.
